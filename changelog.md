### Added

- New guns for the normal starter pack, since having all the guns lagged out the game and crashes lower-end/medium-end computers the full range of guns will be available in ServerStorage for admins to give, I plan to make a loadout GUI soon.

- Made the gun models more realistic and modified them so the bolt matches up with where the hand animation goes.

- Made the maps more realistic.

### Planned

- I plan on making more maps for the game, and a selection GUI. I want to have a full menu, team selection and loadout GUI so the game just overall looks really clean.

- I realised a *few* of the guns did not work, I will fix that shortly.
